# Hello World

I decided to make a personal website. I hope it will help me to organize my mind and collect all my projects at a single location.

I rented an EC2 instance on AWS and I am running a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) web application there. 

Right now, it is made of mostly static pages, except the blogging part. The [blog](/blog) page dynamically lists links of textfile names under a certain folder.

```python
@app.route('/blog/')
def blog():
    post_list = os.listdir('posts')
    return render_template('blog_list.html', post_list=post_list)
```

When a link is clicked the file's content is interpreted as markdown and rendered to HTML via [Flask-Misaka](https://flask-misaka.readthedocs.io).

```python
from flask.ext.misaka import markdown

@app.route('/blog/<post>')
def blog_post(post):
    with open(os.path.join('posts', post), 'rt') as f:
        md_text = f.read()
    html = markdown(md_text, fenced_code=True, math=True)
    return render_template('blog_post.html', post=html)
```    

Some meta information such as date and tags are included in "links as comments in markdown" notation: [syntax - Comments in Markdown - Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4823468/comments-in-markdown).

Markdown, using [Mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/), even allows me to write nicely typeset mathematical expressions in \\( \LaTeX \\). Here is a favorite equation of mine:

$$e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0$$

Whole code of the website is hosted [here](https://github.com/vug/personalwebapp) on GitHub.

Hope I'll have enough patience and persistance to write continuously. Laylay...
