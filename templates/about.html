        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Currently, I live in New York City and work as an algorithm engineer at <a href="http://www.driversiti.com">Driversiti</a>.</p>
        <p>I was born in Ä°stanbul and lived in the same apartment which is in the old historic area that is inside the Byzantian city walls for 27 years.</p>
        <p>There, I studied physics at college. Then I made masters' in physics. My thesis was about picking up relevant events under high rate event generating conditions of high energy physics particle accelerator events.</p>
        <p>However, my heart belonged to theoretical physics and I made PhD on fundamentals of quantum mechanics. To do that I moved to US in 2010. Here, I studied how to tell whether a physical system at hand can be explained only classical physics or quantum mechanics is necessary using a framework called Bell inequalities.</p>
        <p>I'm interested in music, anime, literature, computers, social justice, politics etc.</p>
        <p>I don't like this impact-oriented, self-marketing language of resumes, though, most recent resume is <a href="">here</a>.</p>
